# AutoDeposit

A mod for SPT, inspired by the Quick Stack feature from Terraria. 

## What this mod will do
Click the button added to your equipment, and items will be transferred to constainers in your stash that already contain that same item. This allows you to quickly group multiple copies of items into the same container.
This leaves it up to you, the player, to decide where to put the first instance of any given item that you get. 

If you have containers in your equipment (like a rig in your backpack), it will transfer items inside those containers. 
It will also transfer the container itself if and once they are empty, following the same rules as any other item.
It will not transfer non-empty containers.

## What this mod is NOT
This mod is not a "dump my whole inventoru and automatically sort it into specialty containers" mod. 
The responsibility of organizing your stash is still on you, but (for example) once you've decided that 855A1 ammo goes into that particular ammo box, this mod will deposit future 855A1 into that same box.
