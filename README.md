###  **Way1 Click**

Default Logic:

Click the button added to your equipment, and items will be transferred to containers in your stash that already contain that same item. This allows you to quickly group multiple copies of items into the same container. This leaves it up to you, the player, to decide where to put the first instance of any given item that you get.



If you have containers in your equipment (like a rig in your backpack), it will transfer items inside those containers. It will also transfer the container itself if and once they are empty, following the same rules as any other item. It will not transfer non-empty containers.

### **Way2 - LeftAlt key modificator**

- First,  LeftAlt + Click  => move everything of default logic, other item move to stash root without containers (for example, pull the cartridge out of the chamber, pull everything out of the containers, but leave the parent containers in the inventory). 
- Second, LeftAlt + Click => move empty any "containers" to root stash.


### **Way3 - LeftControl key modificator**

LeftControl + click => move all items to root stash, and at the same time, pull everything out of the containers to root stash without sorting logic from way 1


### **Way4 - LeftShift key modificator**

LeftShift + click => move all items to root stash, but don`t touch items inside any containers and no sorting logic from way 1
